# MasterThesis
Interest Rate Derivatives pricing library for my master's thesis in Economics af the department of Economics, University of Copenhagen.

The repository contains the files "ExampleWorkbook.xlsb" that is intended to be used with the "MastersThesisAddIn.xll". The path to the xll has to be set within the application.

The library contains functionality to calibrate zero-coupon curves from a set of market quotes (as of 31st of January, 2017) and some functionality to calculate risk on a set of linear interest rate products defined within the application.
